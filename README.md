### Machine Learning Project: House Price Prediction with Decision Trees and Random Forest Regression
#
#### Completed Kaggle's Introduction to Machine Learning course, focusing on the prediction of house prices using decision tree regression and Random Forest Regression.
#### Utilized pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for metric analysis and model integration.
#### Demonstrated knowledge of evaluating overfitting and underfitting in decision trees and employed Mean Absolute Error as a metric to measure the average error between predicted and actual values.
